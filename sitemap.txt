Proposed App Structure:

    home: Contains HomePage (root). this will be a collection of data from other pages

    belama: Contains BelamaPage and SignUpPage. (this has a form -- may skip the sign up page for now)
    about: Contains AboutPage, ContactPage (maybe generic pages)
    


    DONE:
        news: Contains NewsIndexPage and NewsArticlePage. DONE
        experience: Contains ExperiencePage, FlightUpgradesPage, BaggageAllowancePage, etc. DONE
        api: API configurations
        core: Contains BasePage, snippets (e.g., author profiles, categories), and utilities.
        schedules: Contains logic for parsing of flight schedule data. FlightSchedulePage could reference this model. 
        fares: contains logic for parsing of fare data (year round fares). Each route page could reference this model.
            explore: Contains ExplorePage, DestinationsIndexPage, DestinationPage, RoutePage, SpecialsIndexPage, SpecialPage, WhereWeFlyPage, FlightSchedulesPage, and CargoPage.


brainstorm how recommendations (destinations, specials) will be handled: snippets maybe


explore:
    explore index page: same as experience index 

        cargo page: generic page 
        destination index: same as explore index 
        special index: same as explore index 
        where we fly: 
            - description
            - domestic image 
            - international image 
        
        flight schedule: 
            - description 
            


booking widget: 
    - manage booking
    - flight upgrades
    - flight schedules
    - flight search/ book a trip


ALL GRIDS:
    - make dynamic grids for all



for specials sections, maybe make it in a way such that the user can select which three specials to display. the possible ones that are displayed must be valid ones (relevant to that page)
