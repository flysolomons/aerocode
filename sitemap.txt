    experience: Contains ExperiencePage, FlightUpgradesPage, BaggageAllowancePage, etc.
    belama: Contains BelamaPage and SignUpPage.
    about: Contains AboutPage.
    news: Contains NewsIndexPage and NewsArticlePage.
    
    schedules: Contains logic for parsing of flight schedule data. FlightSchedulePage could reference this model. 
    fares: contains logic for parsing of fare data (year round fares). Each route page could reference this model.


brainstorm how recommendations (destinations, specials) will be handled: snippets maybe

brainstorm how to routes that fall under each special (AN IMPORTANT ONE)

brainstorm how to handle breadcrumbs
